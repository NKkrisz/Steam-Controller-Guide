# Steam Controller Reassembly Guide
Follow (most of) the steps from the [teardown](./Teardown.md) and [soldering](Soldering.md) guide but backwards. If stuck, see the tips & tricks section below.

## Tips & Tricks
- Make sure the joystick cap is fully pushed into the joystick module's stick to avoid rubbing against the shell or the joystick getting stuck
- 3D printed replacement parts might need additional work done to them (eg. sanding) to make sure they work correctly
- Screwing into 3D printed parts might need more force, make sure there is no gap between parts
- Fully assemble and screw in the battery contacts before trying to solder them back so they stay in place
- Shims might be needed below the triggers to keep the top cover part from coming off in case it's loose
