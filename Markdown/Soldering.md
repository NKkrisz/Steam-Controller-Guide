# Steam Controller Soldering Guide
Follow the [Teardown Guide](./Teardown.md) first to get the board out.

## Tools Needed
- Soldering Iron With Preferably Fine and Knife Tips
- Desoldering Iron / Hot Air Gun / Desoldering Pump
- Tiny Flathead Screwdriver
- Pliers
- Solder Wick
- Solder
- Flux
- Isopropyl alchohol
- Cotton swabs

## Tips & Tricks
- Desoldering the battery contacts can help if you don't have good holder so the board stays flat on the surface it's on
- Be careful not to rip pads off, if something isn't loose try heating it up more, adding extra solder / flux can help
- Sometimes solder wick is better than using a desoldering pump / desoldering iron
- Use a fine soldering tip to clean the holes and when soldering wires
- Use solder wick, isopropyl alcohol and cotton swabs to clean up residue
- Use flux to improve solder joints

## Desoldering Board Components

### Battery Contact Holders
- Try a desoldering pump / desoldering iron on the legs

### Joystick Module
- Try a desoldering pump / desoldering iron on the legs
- If that doesn't work, try separating the potentiometers from the module so they can be desoldered separately
- Prying upwards from the bottom of the joystick module can also help but be careful not to damage the board

### Antenna
- Try a desoldering pump / desoldering iron on the legs
- If that doesn't work, try adding extra solder, heating it up with a soldering iron and pulling the antenna out with pliers / tweezers while it's hot

### USB Port
- Use a hot air gun if possible
- If you don't own a hot air gun or it doesn't work try covering the port in solder, heating it up with a soldering iron and pulling the port off with pliers / tweezers while it's hot
    - Use a knife soldering tip as it has a big and flat surface that's easier to heat up the port with
