# Steam Controller Teardown Guide
For soldered components see the [Soldering Guide](./Soldering.md) after taking the board out.

## Tools Needed
- Long torx t6 screwdriver
- Pry tools & tweezers / steady hands
- Clean and organized workspace (eg. silicone work mat)

## Tips & Tricks
- Place screws and parts grouped together
- Some parts during disassembly can fall out, work somewhere where they can't get lost easily

## Disassembly

### Explanation
- Magenta: things to look out for
- Red: short screw
- Yellow: long screw

### Steam Controller

#### Front Side

#### Back Side
![Original_Back](../Images/Disassembly/Teardown/2_Original_Back.jpg)

### Taking Off The Back Shell

#### Taking Off The Backplate
- Push the slider towards the left grip of the controller, the backplate should "pop off"
- Sometimes the slider can get stuck, try moving it backwards and forwards

#### Taking Out The Batteries
- Push in the battery holder levers and then take out the batteries
- If the batteries are stuck, try prying outwards with thumbs on the top of the batteries

#### Back Shell Screw Locations
- The screws in the middle (2 small, 1 long) are hidden by the sticker from the factory
    - Either try taking off the sticker in one piece or pierce through it with a screwdriver / exacto knife
    - These screws may get stuck in the back shell until the sticker is removed around the top holes
- The outer (4 small) screws are deep in the controller and require a long screwdriver

#### Slider In The Back Shell
- The back shell has the slider to take off the backplate, make sure not to lose the plastic piece and the spring attached to it
- To take it out, push inwards from the top so it lifts up

### Taking Off The Front Shell

#### Front Shell Screw Locations And Battery Holder Levers
- The back shell holds the battery holder levers in place, take them off if they haven't fallen off already
- Take out the (4 long) screws and then slowly lift the board away from the front shell

#### Trackpad Ribbon Cables And Front Buttons Warning
- Disconnect the trackpad ribbon cables from the board with hands or tweezers
- Be careful, after this point the buttons in the front can fall out
