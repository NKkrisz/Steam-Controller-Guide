# Steam-Controller
Information about the Steam Controller's firmware and hardware modifications / repairs.

## Firmware Information
- Initially the controller only worked with a wired connection or wirelessly with a USB receiver
- [An update was released later](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1796-5FC3-88B3-C85F) so the controller can now be used with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) as well
    - Some guides I found on how to update the firmware in case the method in the link above doesn't work:
